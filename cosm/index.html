  <p>Today, <a href="http://www.esa.int/Safety_Security/Space_Debris/European_conference_on_space_debris_risks_and_mitigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>around 750 000 objects larger than 1 cm are orbiting Earth</a>.
    About 18 000 of these pieces of debris are large enough to be regularly monitored by powerful surveillance systems.
    Such monitoring data are used by space agencies such as ESA to avoid collisions.
    The majority of these objects have been generated by more than 250 explosions.</p>
